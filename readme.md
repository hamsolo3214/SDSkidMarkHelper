I stole this idea from sh0rty

 - Go to the ModWork folder `C:\Users\<USER>\Documents\Trackmania2020\Skins\Stadium\ModWork`
   - If it doesn't exist, create it.
      - If Trackmania was running it needs a restart.
 - Put the `CustomSkids` folder in the `ModWork` folder ![ModWorkFolder](./Images/ModWorkFolder.PNG).
   - You can put your own skidmarks here as well, just have the same 3 files, and place a folder in `CustomSkids`
     - In-game under Openplanet -> Settings -> SDSkidMarkHelper replace the skidmark you want with your folder ![CustomSkids1](./Images/CustomSkids.PNG) [!CustomSkids2](./Images/CustomSkids2.PNG)

The plugin swaps these around depending on your speed and drift, if you have old custom skids, you can put them in `DefaultSkids` or backup/delete them. 
The plugin should delete any existing if they are left there.

Put the `SDSkidMarkHelper.op` file in your in your plugins folder, which should be `C:\Users\<USER>\OpenplanetNext\Plugins` ![PluginLocation](./Images/PluginLocation.PNG).

You should now be ready to go.
