 - settings
   - Custom leeway for guuut sd and warning sd?
   - More gradients? Would need a new way to name folders instead of bad/good/warning
   - We can iterate all folders in custom folders, and then pick default based on settings, allowing people to dump custom skids in there
     - would require folderstructure+naming
 - ease-of-use
   - auto download skids to modwork folder from github (see skidmark selector plugin)
   - inform user about need to restart
 - performance
   - ~~only move the skidmark for the relevant surface~~
   - Utilize previousTarget/previousSkids to avoid checking every folder
   - ~~check if the car is touching the ground~~
   - ~~don't need to calculate on surfaces where skidmarks aren't visible, like Ice and Plastic~~
 - readme
   - describe how to use custom custom skids
   - describe how to use the xcf GIMP files/edit the DDS files
 - tech.
   - grass/dirt feedback is based on nothing
     - grass/dirt feedback is now loosely based on shadowcrancers sd maps
 - fun
   - rainbow skidmarks weeeee
