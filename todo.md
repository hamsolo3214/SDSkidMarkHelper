   - ~~Custom leeway for guuut sd and warning sd?~~
   - More gradients? Would need a new way to name folders instead of bad/good/warning
   - We can iterate all folders in custom folders, and then pick default based on settings, allowing people to dump custom skids in there
     - would require folderstructure+naming
     - ~~change default skids~~
 - ease-of-use
   - auto download skids to modwork folder from github (see skidmark selector plugin)
   - ~~inform user about need to restart~~
   - if existing skidmarks are there, put them in ./CustomSkids/OldSkids folder
 - performance
   - ~~only move the skidmark for the relevant surface~~
   - Utilize previousTarget/previousSkids to avoid checking every folder
      - use did_first_time_startup setting variable to verify we have had skids
      - feels error prone?
   - ~~check if the car is touching the ground~~
   - ~~don't need to calculate on surfaces where skidmarks aren't visible, like Ice and Plastic~~
 - readme
   - ~~describe how to use custom custom skids~~
     - could use a better description
   - describe how to use the xcf GIMP files/edit the DDS files
 - tech.
   - dirtsmoke is a file?
   - grass/dirt feedback is based on nothing
     - grass/dirt feedback is now loosely based on shadowcrancers sd maps
   - i don't know how the leeway should be calculated
     - also what is a good leeway?
 - fun
   - rainbow skidmarks weeeee
   - wobble skidmarks?
